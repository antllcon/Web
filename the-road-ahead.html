                Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent
                wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in
                the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless,
                without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint
                in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the
                smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was
                the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of
                life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish
                dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths,
                spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals
                of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged
                along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested
                on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under
                the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and
                narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and
                frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On
                the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten
                down until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life
                is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the
                water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their
                mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission
                man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in
                the end come to the cessation of movement
